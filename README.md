# LIFE

Write a program to play the game of Life. Life is a simple simulation of cell automata.

Life contains a two-dimensional grid of cells. A cell can only be in one of two states: alive or dead. There are two kinds of cells: ConwayCells and FredkinCells.

Once the grid is manually populated with live and/or dead cells, the grid represents the 0th generation of Life. After that, everything is automatic, and Life evolves from the 1st to the Nth generation. A generation is simply the state of the grid (i.e. the layout of the live and dead cells).

#Testing:

1. Google Test for unit testing
2. gcov for code coverage
3. code profiling with gprof
4. automated documentation with doxygen
5. integration with Travis CI
